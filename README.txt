The interface is simple. A map is at the center to show what territories
connect with others. To the sides are lists of each territory along with who
owns them and how many armies are on each territory. In the bottom left is a
prompt box that will ask the user questions. A drop down menu with all the 
territories is used for any decisions regarding picking a territory and a text
area is used for any other yes/no questions or how many armies a person wants
on a territory. The game is implemented as an application and has additional
 save/load feauture. Only one game at a time is saved and it autosaves 
between each phase of someones turn.

Brian Goldsberry did the game logic while Olivia Wiley implemented the GUI.
Specifically, Brian worked on Territory.java, Board.java, Game.java, Deck.java, Card.java, and Player.java while Olivia did BoardWindow.java and modifications to Board.java.
